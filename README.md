Clean architectual pattern and SOLID principles
Use of SwiftUI
API: https://dummyjson.com/products to populate the list of dummy products. The list has refresh functionality
two buttons implemented first to crash the app for testing creashalytics and the second to reload the product list.

Use of CoreData as persistence container
Use of third party dependecy Realm as persistence container
Use of Google Firebase Analytics and Crashalytics
Use of dependency injection and inversion to ease the XCTest implemenmtation for the future unit tests.
